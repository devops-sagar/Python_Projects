# Password Authenticator Module
A password authentication system is a system that is used for the identification of a user. Think of it like a login screen that you see while logging in to your Facebook account. It asks for your email or a username and then it asks for your password. If you have entered the correct password then it verifies you as the real user.  

### Steps
1. Create a dictionary of usernames with their passwords.
2. Then you have to ask for user input as the username by using the input function in Python.
3. Then you have to use the **getpass** module in Python to ask for user input as the password. <ins>Here we are using the getpass module instead of the input function to make sure that the user doesnâ€™t get to see what he/she write in the password field.  </ins>
